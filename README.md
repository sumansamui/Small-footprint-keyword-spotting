## üß† Abstract

Small-Footprint Keyword Spotting (SF-KWS) has gained popularity in today‚Äôs landscape of smart voice-activated devices, smartphones, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This surge is attributed to the advancements in Deep Learning, enabling the identification of predefined words or keywords from a continuous stream of words.

To implement the SF-KWS model on edge devices with low power and limited memory in real-world scenarios, an efficient Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) framework is essential. In this study, we explore seven distinct categories of techniques, namely:

- **Model Architecture**
- **Learning Techniques**
- **Model Compression**
- **Attention-Aware Architectures**
- **Feature Optimization**
- **Neural Network Search**
- **Hybrid Approaches**

This comprehensive overview will serve as a valuable resource for those looking to understand, utilize, or contribute to the field of SF-KWS. The analysis enables the identification of potential research directions, encompassing insights from automatic speech recognition research and those relevant to spoken SF-KWS.
